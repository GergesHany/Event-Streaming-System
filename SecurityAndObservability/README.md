# SecurityAndObservability Module Explanation

## Overview

The `SecurityAndObservability` module is a **comprehensive security framework** within the Event Streaming System project that handles **TLS certificate management, authorization, and access control**. This module demonstrates how to properly secure distributed services through certificate-based authentication, encryption, and policy-based authorization using industry-standard tools and practices.

## Purpose

This module teaches and implements **enterprise-grade security for distributed services**, covering:
- Creating and managing a proper Certificate Authority (CA)
- Generating server and client certificates for mutual TLS (mTLS)
- Implementing policy-based access control with Casbin
- Configuring TLS for both server and client authentication
- Automating certificate management and security workflows

## Key Components

### 1. Authorization System (`pkg/auth/authorizer.go`)

**Purpose**: Policy-based access control using Casbin
- **Enforcer**: Uses Casbin's RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) model
- **Authorization Method**: `Authorize(subject, object, action)` validates permissions
- **Integration**: Returns gRPC-compatible error codes for seamless service integration
- **Flexibility**: Supports complex permission models and dynamic policy updates

**Example Usage**:
```go
authorizer := auth.New("model.conf", "policy.csv")
err := authorizer.Authorize("root", "topic1", "produce") // Returns nil if allowed
```

### 2. TLS Configuration Management (`pkg/config/tls.go`)

**Purpose**: Centralized TLS setup for both server and client configurations
- **Mutual TLS Support**: Configures both server and client certificate authentication
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports server-only and mutual authentication modes
- **Certificate Loading**: Handles X.509 certificate and key pair loading
- **CA Integration**: Manages Certificate Authority certificates for trust chains

**Features**:
- Server-side TLS with client certificate verification
- Client-side TLS with server certificate validation
- Proper certificate pool management
- Error handling for certificate parsing and validation

### 3. Configuration File Management (`pkg/config/files.go`)

**Purpose**: Centralized configuration file path management
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures consistent workspace root loading
- **Environment Variables**: Supports `.env` file configuration
- **Path Constants**: Predefined paths for all certificate and configuration files
- **Thread Safety**: Uses `sync.Once` for safe concurrent access

**Managed Files**:
- CA certificates and keys
- Server certificates and keys  
- Multiple client certificates (root, nobody)
- ACL model and policy files

### 4. Certificate Authority (CA) Setup

**Files**: `test/ca-csr.json`, `test/ca-config.json`
- Creates a Certificate Authority named "My Awesome CA"
- Uses RSA 2048-bit encryption keys
- Configured with sample organizational details (Toronto, Canada)
- Acts as the root trust anchor for all certificates in the system

### 5. Certificate Profiles and Generation

**Server Certificates** (`test/server-csr.json`):
- Configured for local development (localhost/127.0.0.1)
- Includes proper Subject Alternative Names (SANs)
- Server authentication profile with 1-year expiry

**Client Certificates** (`test/client-csr.json`):
- Multiple client certificates: `root-client`, `nobody-client`
- Client authentication profile with 1-year expiry
- Different Common Names (CN) for role-based identification

### 6. Access Control Policies

**Model Configuration** (`test/model.conf`):
- Defines the authorization model structure
- Request format: `(subject, object, action)`
- Policy format: `(subject, object, action)`
- Supports wildcard permissions and role hierarchies

**Policy Rules** (`test/policy.csv`):
- `root` user: Full access to produce and consume from any resource
- Extensible format for adding more granular permissions
- CSV format for easy management and updates

### 7. Build Automation (`Makefile`)

**Operations**:
- **`make init`**: Creates configuration directory (`~/Event-Streaming-System/`)
- **`make gencert`**: Generates complete certificate chain (CA, server, multiple clients)
- **`make test`**: Runs Go tests with race condition detection and copies ACL files
- **`make clean`**: Removes generated certificates and configuration files

## Integration with Other Modules

### Direct Integration Points

**ServeRequestsWithgRPC Module**:
- Uses `TLSConfig` for secure gRPC server setup
- Integrates `Authorizer` for method-level access control
- Leverages generated certificates for mutual TLS authentication

**WriteALogPackage Module**:
- Secures log storage and retrieval operations
- Implements authorization for log access based on user roles
- Encrypts log transmission between services

**StructureDataWithProtobuf Module**:
- Secures protocol buffer message transmission

### Configuration Integration

```go
// Example integration in a gRPC server
tlsConfig, err := config.SetupTLSConfig(config.TLSConfig{
    CertFile:      config.ServerCertFile,
    KeyFile:       config.ServerKeyFile, 
    CAFile:        config.CAFile,
    ServerAddress: "localhost",
    Server:        true,
})

authorizer := auth.New(config.ACLModelFile, config.ACLPolicyFile)
```

## Security Considerations

### Development vs. Production

**Development Configuration**:
- Certificates configured for localhost/127.0.0.1
- Simple policy rules for testing
- Self-signed CA for isolated development

**Production Recommendations**:
- Replace with production CA certificates
- Implement proper certificate rotation (automated)
- Use hardware security modules (HSMs) for CA private key protection
- Deploy comprehensive audit logging

### Key Security Practices

**Certificate Management**:
- CA private key is the most critical component - must be secured
- Implement certificate revocation lists (CRL) or OCSP
- Regular certificate rotation (recommend 90-day cycles for production)
- Separate CA keys from operational certificates

**Access Control**:
- Regularly audit and update policy files
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Monitor authorization decisions for anomalies
- Use different certificates for different service roles

**Operational Security**:
- Secure certificate storage (encrypted at rest)
- Implement proper key escrow procedures
- Monitor certificate expiry dates
- Maintain disaster recovery procedures for certificate infrastructure

### Compliance and Standards

- **TLS 1.2/1.3**: Modern TLS versions with strong cipher suites
- **X.509**: Standard certificate format with proper extensions
- **RBAC**: Industry-standard role-based access control
- **Zero Trust**: Verify every connection and request
